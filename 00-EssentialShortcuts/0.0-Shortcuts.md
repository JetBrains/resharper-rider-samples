# Shortcuts And Actions

Through out this guided experience, you will see "shortcut" tags. 
These tags include the official name of each action and can be found
using the the `Find Action...` feature of your IDE. Reference your
preferences to find out what that shortcut is, but here are a few known
shortcut combinations: 

- ReSharper Keymap on Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + A`
- Visual Studio Keymap on Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + A`
- Visual Studio Keymap on macOS: `Command (⌘) + Shift (⇧) + A`
