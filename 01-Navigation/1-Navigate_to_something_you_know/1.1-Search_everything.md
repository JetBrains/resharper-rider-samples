<shortcut id="Search Everywhere">`Ctrl+T (VS)`</shortcut>

1.  Navigate to type, symbol or file
    Type "example", showing `ExampleCode.cs`, `Example_code.js`, the "GoToFileMemberExample" type,
    the "example" function in `Example_code.js` and the "ExampleCode" folder
    Open these files

2.  Displays recently open files by default
    Filter by typing

3.  Use CamelHumps to navigate to the `DocumentViewModel` type
    Type "DVM" in popup
    Can also use lowercase "dvm"

4.  Use middle matching - type "view" to match `DocumentViewModel`,
    `SettingsViewModel` and more

5.  Use wildcards - type "D*M" to match `DocumentViewModel`

6.  Search for "Person" will yield a variety of results, including methods
    like `AddPerson`, `RemovePerson`, ...
