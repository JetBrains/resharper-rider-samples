Go To Type

Navigate to type by type name

Ctrl+T, Ctrl+T (VS)
Ctrl+N, Ctrl+N (IntelliJ)

Go to type is invoked by first invoking Go to Everything, then hitting the
keyboard shortcut again. It's a means of narrowing the search to just types

1. Navigate to the Person type - type "Person" in popup

2. Navigate to the DocumentViewModel type - type "DocumentViewModel" in popup

3. Use "CamelHumps" to navigate to DocumentViewModel - type "DVM" in popup

4. Mix "CamelHumps" and naming to navigate to SettingsViewModel
   Type "SVM" in popup
   Shows "SettingsViewManager" and "SettingsViewModel"
   Continue typing to narrow search - "SVMod" filters to "SettingsViewModel"

5. Navigate to any view model with middle matching - type "view" in popup
   Matches the middle of the symbol name - also works with CamelHumps

6. Navigate to DocumentViewModel using wildcard mathing - type "D*M" in popup

7. Navigate to library types when type not defined in current project
   type "Console" in popup

8. Include library types in search when type matches
   Navigate to System.Data.DataViewManager
   Type "DVM" in popup, then hit Alt+N to include library types
