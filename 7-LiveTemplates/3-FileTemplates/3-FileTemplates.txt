File Templates

Generate a new file, based on a live template

Generate From File

Ctrl+Alt+Ins (VS + IntelliJ)

Generate (when focus is on Solution Explorer)

Alt+Ins (VS + IntelliJ)


1. Add Class, Interface, Struct or Enum
   Invoke Generate From File, or select Solution Explorer and invoke Generate
   Because this project is a C# project, you see a Generate menu with Class,
     Interface, Struct, Enum
   Web projects also include options for web forms, MVC forms, controls, etc

2. Add Folder
   Select a folder or project in the Solution Explore and invoke Generate
   Select Folder (not displayed in Generate From File menu, or if a file is selected)

3. Edit existing templates
   ReSharper -> Templates Explorer -> File Templates
   Select C#
   Double-click on "Class" template
   Add a C# comment to the class and save the template
   (Because we're editing a built-in template, the changed version is removed from
    quicklist section. Drag and drop it back into the quicklist. This appears to be
	a bug - http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RSRP-368017)
   Use Generate From File, or select Solution Explorer and use Generate and see the
     comment added to the new class

4. Create new template
   ReSharper -> Templates Explorer -> File Templates
   Select C#
   Click the "New Template" toolbar button
   Set the default file name. This is the name used by default to create the file, and
     will have a number appended, e.g. "Class" becomes "Class1", "Class2", etc). Set this
	 to "TextFile.txt"
   Give the template a description, e.g. "Text file"
   Enter some text to be in the file by default, e.g. "Hello world"
   Save the template, by default it will go into the "not in quicklist" section
   Put the focus on the Solution Explorer and select ReSharper -> Edit -> New From Template -> More
   Select "Text file" and a new text file is added to the project
   Go back to the Templates Explorer, and move Text file into the quicklist section
   Invoke Generate from File, or select Solution Explorer and invoke Generate and select Text file

5. Create multi-file template
   A multi-file template is a template that creates more than one file. We will create
     a template that creates an interface and an implementation class
   ReSharper -> Templates Explorer -> File Templates
   Select C#
   Click the "New Template" toolbar button
   Set the default file name to NewAbstraction.cs
   Enter the following text (similar to the interface template)

namespace $NAMESPACE$
{
  public interface I$FILENAME$ {$END$}
}

   On the right of the editor window:
     Select "Choose macro" for $NAMESPACE$ and set it to "Default namespace for current file"
	 Select "Choose macro" for $FILENAME$ and set it to "Current file name without extension"
	 Set both parameters to not editable
   At the bottom of the window, click "Add new file"
   Leave the placement and folder options unchanged
   Change the filename to $NAME$.implementation.cs
   Enter the following text:

namespace $NAMESPACE$
{
  public class $FILENAME$ {$END$}
}

   Save the file template, and move it to the quicklist
   Invoke Generate from File, or select Solution Explorer and invoke Generate and select "Interface and implementation"
   Enter a name for the new abstraction, e.g. Engine. ReSharper will generate an Engine.cs file
     for the interface, and an Engine.class.cs file for the implementation
