# Search By Type

Navigate to type by type name

<shortcut id="Search Everywhere">Ctrl+T</shortcut> then `Tab` to focus on only "Classes".

Search by Type is invoked by first invoking Go to Everything, then navigating to the "Classes" tab.
It's a means of narrowing the search to just types.

1. Navigate to the `Person` type - type "Person" in popup

2. Navigate to the `DocumentViewModel` type - type "DocumentViewModel" in popup

3. Use "CamelHumps" to navigate to `DocumentViewModel` - type "DVM" in popup

4. Mix "CamelHumps" and naming to navigate to `SettingsViewModel`
   Type "SVM" in popup
   Shows `SettingsViewManager` and `SettingsViewModel`
   Continue typing to narrow search - "SVMod" filters to `SettingsViewModel`

5. Navigate to any view model with middle matching - type "view" in popup
   Matches the middle of the symbol name - also works with CamelHumps

6. Navigate to `DocumentViewModel` using wildcard matching - type "D*M" in popup

7. Navigate to library types when type not defined in current project
   type "Console" in popup

8. Include library types in search when type matches
   Navigate to `System.Data.DataViewManager`
   Type "DVM" in popup, then hit Alt+N to include library types

9. Navigate to type with namespace Type `System.Data.DataViewManager`

10. Uses spaces to allow quick matching of namespace
    Type "s d dvm" for `System.Data.DataViewManager`
