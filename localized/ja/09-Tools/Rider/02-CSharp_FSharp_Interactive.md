# C# / F# Interactive

Allows running C# or F# statements without having to wait for compilation.

1. Open either:
    * C# Interactive from _Tools \| C# Interactive \| Start new C# Interactive session_.
    * F# Interactive from _Tools \| F# Interactive \| Start new F# Interactive session_.
2. Run some code, e.g. for C#: `var name = "Tom";`, press enter. `"Hello " + name`, press enter.
   See the evaluation results.
3. Go back in history: up/down arrows let us replay previous statements.
4. The toolbar on the left lets us go through history as well. A transcript of our session can also be opened.
5. Use Go to Everything and navigate to a `Person` class. Select the code for it and press Alt+Enter.
   Use "Send Selection to C# Interactive".
